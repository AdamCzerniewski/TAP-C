# TAP-C 

## Overview

- **What is this program?** 
  The Python program is based off of what originally was a GW BASIC program (which is provided in the repository for reference)   

- **Why was this program made?**
  The purpose of this program is to calculate the component values for impedance matching in tap C circuit topology.   
  

- **What does the program do?**  
  The app calculates the component values based on circuit insertion loss entered by the user.
  The app provides a frequency sweep, table, and graph to study the circuit
